Compared to verification of correctness properties, the translation from source code to logic can be very simple and thus easy to solve by automated theorem provers. In this paper, we present a translation of Java into logic that is suitable for proving the presence of contradictions in code. We show that the translation, which is based on the Jimple language, can be used to analyze real-world programs, and discuss some issues that arise from differences between Java code and its bytecode.},
